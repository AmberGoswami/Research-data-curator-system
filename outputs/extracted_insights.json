Widespread microglial engraftment led to reductions in plaque load, dystrophic neurites, and astrogliosis, as well as preservation of neuronal density in the plaque-dense subiculum, and iMG adopt diverse transcriptional responses to differing neuropathologies, which could be harnessed to enable widespread and pathology-responsive delivery of therapeutics to the CNS"
