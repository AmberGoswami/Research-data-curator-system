    "key_findings": "Engineered iPSC-microglia expressing neprilysin under the control of the plaque-responsive promoter CD9, delivered brain-wide in Alzheimer's disease mice, reduced multiple biochemical measures of pathology. Widespread microglial engraftment led to reductions in plaque load, dystrophic neurites, and astrogliosis and preservation of neuronal density within the plaque-dense subiculum, and iMGs adopt diverse transcriptional responses to differing neuropathologies, suggesting potential for widespread and pathology-responsive therapeutic delivery to the CNS."

    "key_findings": "Engineered metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) enhance CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing precision and efficiency by offering tunable porosity, high cargo-loading capacity, and biocompatibility, demonstrating superior performance over conventional nonviral systems with improved stability, transfection efficiency, and reduced off-target effects. MOF-based delivery systems hold transformative potential in overcoming challenges associated with gene-editing technologies, such as immunogenicity and cytotoxicity, paving the way for their application in precision medicine"
